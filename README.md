Webrebels.org 2013
=============

This is the web site for the Web Rebels conference 2013.



Development Environment
-----------------------

This package has a small node.js server seving the duty of serving this
static page over http. In the root of this project, run the following:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

You should now be able to access the site at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

We keep this simple and code this in plain html, css and js. No need for server side rendering.
