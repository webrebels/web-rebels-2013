        <h1>About the Web Rebels Conference</h1>
        <p>
          The Web Rebels conference takes place on the 23&ndash;24th
          of May 2013 in Oslo, Norway. We are a non-profit, community
          driven conference for everyone who loves developing
          applications and services using web technology. We had a
          great time hosting the conference for the first time last
          year, and we are very excited to once again welcome all of
          our friends around the world!
        </p>
        <h2>We Love the Community</h2>
        <p>
          We love our community and we <a
          href="http://bit.ly/wr-love">offered 30% of the profits made
          last year</a> to community groups throughout the Nordic
          region. We want to give something back to the community that
          fuels our conference this year as well.
        </p>
