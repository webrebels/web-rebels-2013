<h1>About the Web Rebels Conference</h1>

<p>The Web Rebels conference takes place on the 23-24th of May 2013 in Oslo, Norway. We are a non-profit, community driven conference for everyone who loves developing applications and services using web technology. We had a great time hosting the conference for the first time last year and we are very excited to once again welcome all of our friends around the world!</p>

<p>We love our community and we <a href="http://bit.ly/wr-love">gave away 30% of the profits made last year</a> to community groups throught the Nordic region.

<p>We love all things related to developing on and for the web: the cornerstones today like JavaScript and standards, new languages such as TypeScript or mature alternatives such as ClojureScript, potentially disruptive technology like WebRTC or PhoneGap , and the tools we use to create amazing experiences. We would love to have people talk about all of it at our conference!</p>
