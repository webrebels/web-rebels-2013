		<h1>About the Web Rebels Conference</h1>
		<p>The Web Rebels conference takes place on the 23-24th of May 2013 in Oslo, Norway. We are a non-profit, community driven conference for everyone who loves developing applications and services using web technology. We had a great time hosting the conference for the first time last year and we are very excited to once again welcome all of our friends around the world!</p>

		<p>We love our community and we <a href="http://bit.ly/wr-love">offered 30% of the profits made last year</a> to community groups throughout the Nordic region.</p>

		<p>We love all things related to developing on and for the web: the cornerstones today like JavaScript and standards, new languages such as TypeScript or mature alternatives such as ClojureScript, potentially disruptive technology like WebRTC or PhoneGap , and the tools we use to create amazing experiences. We would love to have people talk about all of it at our conference!</p>

		<p>Everyone taking part in the Web Rebels Conference must abide by the <a href="http://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html">JSConf Code of Conduct</a>. We all want these couple of days to be unforgettable, so let's just have a great time!</p>
