        <h1>Open Mic Night</h1>

        <p>At <a href="http://2012.webrebels.org/openmic/">last year's
          Open Mic Night</a>, attendants and speakers got to hang out
          and listen to some briliant talks by some of the amazing
          local talent. One of them is coming back as a speaker at
          this years conference. This is exactly why we hosted the
          Open Mic Night: to help promote new talent!
        </p>
        <h2>Here's How Open Mic Night Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Open Mic Night is a small pre-party</li>
            <li>Batches of 10 minute lightning talks from our Call For Papers</li>
            <li>Hang out with speakers and attendants whom you'll be spending the next couple of days with</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On the 22th of May we will host a small pre-party. During
          this pre-party we will run a few 30 minutes Open Mic
          lightning talk sessions. The location is large enough for
          most of our attendees, but the stage area will be small and
          intimate. It's all shoulders down in a relaxed environment
          with no high expectations. Think of this as a pre-party
          where you get to know everyone who will be at the conference
          and this is an opportunity to get a head start before the
          big event.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Dear attendee: this is your night!</strong></p>

        <p>
          If you would like to have a go on stage, you are more than
          welcome. Prepare a talk, ~10 minutes, on any relevant topic
          you like and send us your abstract in an email to
          <a href="mailto:openmic@webrebels.org">openmic@webrebels.org</a>
          before the 18th of May with your name and the title of your
          talk and we will give you the stage!
        </p>
        <h3>This is your chance to shine!</h3>
        <p>
          There is always a first time for everything. There is a
          first time for when you laid your hand on a keyboard, there
          is a first time for when you wrote "hello world," and there
          is a first time for when you released some code you wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have picked some awesome rock stars to speak at Web
          Rebels. They are experienced in the art of public speaking.
          But: there was also a first time for them when they first
          spoke in public.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you see them up there on the stage they might look like
          gurus, but they are no different from everyone else. They
          sure are good in what they do, but they are only different
          in the fact that they have taken the step to speaking in
          public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through organising <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/framsia/">meetups</a>
          on a regular basis and keeping our eyes open for whatâ€™s going
          on around us, we see so much cool stuff being done by not yet
          rock stars. You attendees know so much and create so much
          amazing stuff that we are regularly blown away. We think you
          should be given the chance to show off. But, yes, we know,
          that first step can be hard to take.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we would like to create an environment where those who
          would love to try or take the first step towards public
          speaking can get a chance to do so during Web Rebels.
