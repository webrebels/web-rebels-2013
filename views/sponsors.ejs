        <a class="sponsorLogo microsoft" href="http://bit.ly/iemodern"></a>

        <p>Internet Explorer 10 is one web platform that provides two browsing experiences: the new Windows Internet Explorer in the new Windows UI optimized for touch devices, and the traditional browsing experience of Internet Explorer for the desktop. As a Windows Store app, Internet Explorer 10 runs without plug-ins so that you have a clean, fast, and secure web browsing experience, though it does provide a native Flash player. By removing plug-in dependencies from their sites and opting instead for analogous standards-based technologies, web developers can benefit from better site interoperability and easier maintenance.</p>
        <p>Internet Explorer invests heavily in tools that help developers build for Internet Explorer and other browsers. Modern.IE is one such tool that detects common coding practices that may cause compatibility problems or prevent your users from getting the best possible experience on a webpage. Whenever possible <a href="http://bit.ly/iemodern">Modern.IE</a> suggests a fix or enhancement with web standards like HTML5 & CSS3 (or a graceful fallback). It's not a complete checklist for coding the modern web â€“ just a starting point so you can spend less time testing for IE and more time building what matters on the web.</p>

        <a class="sponsorLogo amedia" href="http://utvikling.amedia.no/"></a>

        <p>Amedia Utvikling has 47 employees in Norway and 12 in Bangkok. Among our
        ranks we have developers, product developers, designers, editorial
        developers, interaction designers and even a few poets. Our teams are made
        up of seniors and juniors with expertise from frontend to backend,
        business development and content development. We have offices in Oslo,
        Bergen and Bangkok. The people and the know-how are the result of the
        merger of the former A-pressen Interaktiv and Edda Utvikling.</p>

        <p>In the development department we are organised into teams serving the
        online newspapers, classifieds, football and user-centred content. In
        addition, we have a DevOps team that ensures the solutions we produce can
        both be operated and enhanced. We also have a department devoted to
        editorial and commercial development.</p>

        <p>On the server side, our applications are written in different languages,
        but mainly Java, PHP, Node.js and Ruby. We believe in using the right tool
        for the job, and are committed to maintaining a setting conducive to the
        interaction of diverse technologies, as opposed to a monoculture. We use
        the latest frameworks and libraries. We abide by the the 'release and
        roll-out often' philosophy, and attach great importance to keeping the
        developer's toolbox continually maintained. We have modular solutions and
        modern technology (for the most part).</p>
