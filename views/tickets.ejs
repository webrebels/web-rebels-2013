<h2>You can travel and stay in Norway cheaply</h2>
<p><a href="http://norwegian.no">Norwegian</a> and <a href="http://sas.no">Scandinavian Airlines</a> both have lower priced tickets on sale which you can get if you make reservations early. Norwegian tends to be the cheapest option.</p>
<p>Hotels can be expensive, so we've arranged for a rebel discount on the hotels at the venue. Read about the <a href="/location">hotel discounts</a> for more information.</p>
